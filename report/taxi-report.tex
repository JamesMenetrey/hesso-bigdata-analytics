\section{Introduction}
The goal of this laboratory is to identify the most used areas from New York City, from a taxi agency point of view, to open new agency locations, in order to increase profit and customer satisfaction. This analysis aims to highlight two topics of interest: (1) the best locations to find out customers, and (2) identify the most profitable spots in New York City, which are the longest trips.


\section{Dataset}
The dataset, provided by Chris Whong, is the list of trips and fares of the taxi in New York City. It is composed of 2 parts, which are themselves fragmented into 13 CVS. These parts are the trips related information (trip\_data.7z, sized 1.72GB) and the fares related to each trip (trip\_fare.7z, sized 4.1GB). Each trip contains the following information:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Taxi identification
  \item Driver identification
  \item Start time and end time
  \item GPS coordinates of pick up and drop off
  \item Fare information (amount, payment type, tip)
\end{itemize}
